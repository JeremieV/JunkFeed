# Stateless feed

Completely stateless and open source feed builder. Because why not.

##Â Todo

- support importing and pointing to opml files
  - when doing so, display or use opml title and desc in the meta
- display some opml recommendations on the start page
- move the feed data to the top
- improve the feed badges, use feed title instead of domain, make a cross for deleting, selection (?), make red on error and orange on timeout
- improve mobile responsiveness
- check that the nextjs cache is working on feeds
- support sitemaps? (https://www.bloomberg.com/feeds/sitemap_news.xml)
